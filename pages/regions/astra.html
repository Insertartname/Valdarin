<button type="button" class="collapsible">Old Steel Age</button>
<div class="content">
      <p>The first people were full elves and human beings, they lived with much turmoil, and civil wars for territory, the land was vastly rich for growing food and developing settlements, while Elves. The Elves were the victors but Leonardo Machaeveli I (Elf), took a different approach and proposed a treaty, splitting territories in half. The country was mostly segregated with little turmoils from time to time that settled quickly, the first major change that impacted Astra was the invasion of outside enemies, such as giants, orcs, and goblins. Machaeveli II (half-elf) constructed the first grand Astra Army composed of humans and elves alike. Due to the rich soil and the main attraction the vast iron ores could be constructed into Steel, which brought in more elves and humans. Leonardo proposed the idea that there needed to be an army constructed to fend off all possible outside attacks since the country was mostly united, it was easy to fall under his leadership. The founding families are Machiavelli (Elf), Darmon(Elf), Marcel(Elf), Christiano(Human), and Reign(Human). The days of farming were over, your average civilians turned into participants in various wars, and then their sons after them.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Great Steel Age</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>After many years of fighting, the wars brought elves and humans closer and closer, forgetting about their past wars and breeding with each other to make Half-elves. Leonardo Machaeveli II proposed an idea that shaped Astra forever, with the great army ever expanding taking in occupants by the minute. Astra expanded into other territories. Due to their large armies, they conquered the other lands including the species that started the first invasions, orcs, goblins, and giants alike. The Astrian army also colonised areas that were not as developed but provided for those who couldn’t protect themselves. After colonising a territory, the Astrians took in any race that was willing to serve the country. Most humans mated with other races, they were the most open to branch, often for the sake of survival. 
 Upon progression, Astria established a system that soaked in more army members and squeezed out the others. If you wanted to branch out, you were free to, but you first had to serve.</p>
<h5>The Gauntlet establishment</h5>
<p>From age 5 to age 18, children are taken in, a school system meant to shape the future of Astran society. It’s an establishment that is meant to put the high and low-born kids on an equal footing. This gives even the lowest-born kids plenty of opportunity to be raised within society.  You retain a schedule that you must follow each year. There are vacation weeks spread throughout the year, the students leave to go home and there are visitation days as well. At 16 you must take community service up until you graduate from the academy. At 18 after graduating, you choose to take part in the army or branch out into whatever career path you choose. Low-ranking students who branch out are allowed an allowance for 5 years. </p>
<p>Common core system classes -  Math, Languages, Science + Iron studies, History, social learning skills 
Agriculture classes - studying and practising farming, how to grow your food, and how to make meals. </p>
<p>Combatant classes - martial arts training, self-defence, unconventional fighting, weapon training 
 PE - cardio, strength training, yoga, sports
 survival training -  survival training is classes that teach how to preserve your life when in unplanned situations.</p>
<p>Community service - after reaching a certain age you are required to take jobs, rather than becoming cupbearers for generals, kitchen duties, maids, and servers for army men. Those are basic jobs. As long as you can serve in some way then you are welcome. 
Sponsored community service - community services from rich or high-ranking members of society, much more potent than default jobs. High-born students are chosen by family members, if you aren’t high you have a chance of becoming a high-ranking student, which is often chosen. If you have multiple sponsors then you 
choose the person you work under, one will be recommended based on the career path you want to go to.
After graduating, you are allowed to branch out into whatever path you go to. Most students often pick the military. </p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">New Steel Age</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>With the army expanding over time, the country also branched into new territory, their largest partnership is with the country of Ordron, and they share a similar work-for-your-earning-like mindset. Astra provides Iron and protection while Odron provides weapons and shipping vehicles. Helicarriers, Tumblers, fighter jets, cargo planes, weapons of all kinds. In the new age with multiple opportunities provided there are factions created by Gauntlet graduates to progress the lives of Astrians.</p>

      During the 2280s Astra began its initative to bring Fedinia countries into its control. Through talks or force, the astrans began capture  land violating United Council's laws. The Grand Druid, Nora (), protested and Astra was charged with fees but continued. Nora saw this as an invasion and did the unspeakable to prevent further  <p>The <li><a href="#">Death Blossom War</a></li>  </p>

      <p>The Battleground contains a series of arenas, that connect to each other by well constructed roads that you can walk or drive on.
