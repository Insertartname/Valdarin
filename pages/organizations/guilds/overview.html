    <hr>
    <p>Established during the medieval era, guilds are an organziation created by like-minded individuals. While there are a wide variety of guild types such as merchant or scholastic, the Mage Council keeps track of Adevnture and Arcane guilds.</p>

    <p>With the advancement of technology guilds have had to adapt to times. Guilds are registered as businesses and must go through the proper channels in their creation. All guilds must have records of their members including: medical health, DOB, age, height, weight, physical features, and their ranking. This information must be updated weekly as well as any missions completed. When a member is deceased their body must be sent to guild hospital for autopsy. All guilds must make number of deaths open to government officials but do not have to make them public. </p>

    <h3>Guild Membership</h3>
<p> Guilds membership is typically open to the public and works similarly to a job application. Those seeking to be an adventurer go through a fitness test designed by each individual guild. This may include simple test or bracket based fights to determine who can join. Not much is known about thieves' guild application as it is difficult to gather inforamtion. We do know that the Black Claws require earning 4 "marks" before you can join. All guild members, except for thieves' guilds, are given a guild license indicating: rank, guild name, DOB, and signature. Additionally, all guilds must provide health (dental included) care, family benefits, paid time off, vacation, parental time off, missions for parents that still pay same wage but lower risk missions, and other benefits dependent on nations worker laws. For more information please look at a region's website.</p>
